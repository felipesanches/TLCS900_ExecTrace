This is an attempt to make a smart disassembler for the TLCS900H CPU, so that I can use it to study the firmware of the Technics KN5000 music keyboard and hopefully be able to implement a working emulation driver for it on MAME.

The Neo Geo Pocket scene may also find this tool useful, as it uses the same CPU ;-)

This disassembler uses my own project ExecTrace, available at https://github.com/felipesanches/ExecTrace and also successfully used to disassemble bytecode of othe virtual machine of Eric Chahi's Another World game (See the tools at https://github.com/felipesanches/AnotherWorld_VMTools).
